    a coherent, detailed 3D model using Artec Studio 17 software. The point cloud is
    converted into a mesh, which is a solid 3D model, and the texture data captured by
    the scanner is mapped back onto the mesh to add color, markings, and other details.
    The final 3D model can be exported into other software platforms, such as Blender
    and Instant Mesh, both of which are open-source.</p>

    <p ="true"="" slot="col-1">To optimize the model for web use, it must be reduced significantly in size. To
    achieve this, the polygon count is reduced using Instant Mesh, and the resulting
    low-polygon model is unwrapped, and the texture and additional details are added
    through a process called “baking” onto the model using normal mapping. This is a
    commonly used technique in film and video game production to reduce file sizes, processing
    power, and other resources required.</p>

Scientists from across the country then assembled to repair the instruments in San Francisco harbor.      Wave gliders are one type of autonomous marine research platform deployed at sea during S-MODE's field campaigns in the Pacific Ocean. The uncrewed vessels feature a set of fins – on a submersible platform tethered to a surface float – which it uses to propel the craft around the upper ocean. The platforms carry a variety of sensors and instruments. Because they're autonomous, their use reduces the risk posed to human researchers who could be exposed to large storms at sea.      S-MODE is a NASA Earth mission to use newly developed in-situ and remote-sensing techniques to look at small-scale ocean whirlpools, eddies, and currents. The observations could help scientists better understand how these dynamics drive the give-and-take of material and energy between the ocean and atmosphere and, ultimately, help shape Earth's climate.
